# EdDSA signature

EdDSA signature is a digital signature scheme using a variant of [Schnorr signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr\_signature) based on [twisted Edwards curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted\_Edwards\_curve). It is designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security.&#x20;
