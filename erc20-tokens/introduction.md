# Introduction

Our SDK provides a few methods to interact with ERC20 tokens. Use this section to help transfer, withdraw, deposit, and build swap orders for your tokens. Currently the Loopring DEX only supports tokens that are registered in our contract.



You can find the list of tokens by using the `api/v3/exchange/info`.



If you would like to register a new token, please submit a registration request here:
